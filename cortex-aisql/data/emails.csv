14,1830,2025-01-01 18:10:27.000,I'd appreciate a refund for the unused Saturday ticket (Order #TR789456) or at least credit toward a future event. I've been a loyal customer for three years and have attended over 20 shows through your platform.
29,1462,2025-01-02 02:58:53.000,"Also, quick heads up - there seems to be a glitch in your mobile app where the venue map isn't loading properly for upcoming shows. I've attached another screenshot showing what I'm seeing."
166,177,2025-01-02 05:52:16.000,"While I have you, I wanted to share some feedback about your new mobile app. The dark mode feature is fantastic, and I love how you've organized the electronic music categories into more specific subgenres. However, the payment processing seems slower than before, and twice last week, I was charged twice for the same ticket (though one charge was eventually reversed)."
57,632,2025-01-02 07:45:44.000,"Also, the new paperless ticket system is generally great, but the app has been super glitchy lately. Sometimes it takes forever to load my QR code at the entrance, which was particularly embarrassing at last month's drum & bass night when there was a huge line behind me."
91,1813,2025-01-02 16:09:49.000,"Also, I purchased tickets for the Summer Electronica Festival next month (Order #EF-2023-8867), but realized I double-booked that weekend. What's your refund policy? If a refund isn't possible, I'd be happy to list them on your official resale platform."
149,1320,2025-01-02 18:26:38.000,"Additionally, I wanted to provide some feedback about the new notification system. As someone who primarily listens to indie rock and alternative music, I'm getting bombarded with notifications about country music events. While I appreciate staying informed about upcoming shows, it would be great if the notifications were more tailored to my interests based on my previous ticket purchases or maybe a preference setting I could adjust."
16,466,2025-01-03 00:14:32.000,I'm also wondering if you could clarify your refund policy for postponed events. The FAQ section isn't very clear about this.
128,603,2025-01-04 02:07:15.000,"One suggestion - it would be amazing if you could add a notification system for when our favorite genres are featured in upcoming events. I mainly follow progressive house and techno, and sometimes miss out on great shows because I don't check the website regularly enough."
649,1033,2025-01-04 02:38:30.000,"I urgently need assistance with transferring my ticket, as I have to finalize plans with my sister and time is of the essence."
139,681,2025-01-04 04:57:30.000,"Also, I purchased VIP passes for the summer music series, but my confirmation email shows standard admission. I paid $189.50 for each pass (3 in total), and I'd appreciate if someone could verify this was processed correctly."
571,1035,2025-01-04 07:17:27.000,"Here is the rewritten version:

I am writing to bring to your attention an issue with my recent purchase, which was made on March 15th for a total of $289.50. The ticket reference number for this transaction is TIX-2023-89445."
129,1399,2025-01-05 04:15:04.000,"On a separate note, I processed a refund for the cancelled Electronic Music Festival three weeks ago but haven't received the money back yet. The confirmation number is TXN-2023-89472. Could you please look into this?"
65,1310,2025-01-05 18:39:25.000,"I attended the electronic music festival at Moonlight Gardens last weekend and wanted to share some thoughts. While DJ Starweaver's set was incredible (that bass drop at 1 AM was insane!), I noticed several issues with the venue's sound system during the early acts. There was noticeable distortion coming from the left speaker stack during the first two performances."
15,890,2025-01-06 02:25:38.000,"I attended the Summer Vibes Festival last weekend and need help with a few things. First, my friend and I noticed that our tickets were double-charged (Order #VF-29847 and #VF-29848). I've attached a screenshot of my bank statement showing both charges."
39,66,2025-01-06 05:45:20.000,"Also, heads up - the drink prices shown on your mobile app are different from what's actually being charged at the venue. Last weekend, the app showed $8 for craft beers, but I was charged $12 at the bar."
60,519,2025-01-06 13:37:39.000,"I've been trying to transfer my tickets for next month's jazz festival to my sister since I unfortunately can't make it anymore due to a work commitment. I've spent the last 30 minutes on your website attempting to do this but keep getting an error message (screenshot attached) whenever I click the ""Transfer Tickets"" button. This is really frustrating as these weren't cheap - I paid $175 for the weekend pass!"
103,967,2025-01-06 13:59:30.000,"However, I do find it frustrating that the early bird tickets sell out within seconds. Perhaps implementing a queue system like other venues would make it fairer for regular attendees like myself?"
147,88,2025-01-06 17:35:30.000,"There was also a small issue with the sound system during last week's performance - there was some feedback during the quieter passages that really affected the experience, especially during the piano solos."
89,202,2025-01-06 21:29:48.000,"That said, I absolutely loved the production quality at last week's symphonic metal showcase. The light show during the headline act was mind-blowing! Though I noticed the merch stand's card reader wasn't working properly - might want to look into that for future events."
126,914,2025-01-07 12:54:05.000,I'd appreciate a response within 48 hours as the festival is next weekend.
647,1088,2025-01-08 06:32:12.000,"During last week's show, we encountered a minor technical issue with the sound system, which caused some distracting feedback during the softer moments, particularly noticeable during the piano solos."
163,92,2025-01-08 14:10:16.000,"While I have you, I just wanted to say that the new QR code system you implemented last month is fantastic - so much smoother than the old paper tickets! However, the drink token feature in the app is still quite buggy."
21,1164,2025-01-08 16:48:39.000,"Also, quick question - my payment for the Summer Bass Series (3-event package) shows as ""pending"" in my account for over a week now, but the money has already left my bank account. Could you please check this for me?"
39,1520,2025-01-09 09:24:57.000,"While I have you, I wanted to mention that I've been a regular attendee at your monthly jazz nights for the past year, and I particularly love the intimate setting of your basement venue. The acoustics are fantastic! However, lately it feels like these events have become less frequent - we used to have them every first Friday, but the last two months were skipped without notice. Any chance you could keep us updated about scheduling changes through your newsletter?"
549,1111,2025-01-10 01:13:30.000,"I'm experiencing some issues with the new mobile app, specifically with accessing digital tickets. The loading time can be quite slow, taking up to 5 minutes, which can be frustrating, especially when trying to enter an event."
15,607,2025-01-10 19:52:59.000,"This is really frustrating because  I spent $385 on these VIP passes and the festival is in just 10 days. I've been looking forward to seeing the sunset DJ set and that new underground techno artist from Berlin, but my boss just scheduled an unavoidable business trip. I really need to get these tickets transferred ASAP."
30,146,2025-01-10 20:45:21.000,"I purchased 2 VIP tickets ($189 each) under booking reference MF2023-45721. Given that the event is in 3 weeks, I'm getting quite anxious about this issue. I really need to transfer these tickets as I unfortunately can't attend anymore due to a family wedding."
131,325,2025-01-11 06:57:25.000,"Lastly, I attempted to get a refund for the ""Urban Beats Festival"" tickets (purchased on Dec 15th) within your 48-hour window, but my request was denied. I have screenshots of the confirmation email showing the purchase time and my refund request submission."
82,268,2025-01-11 14:52:01.000,"I've been trying to get this sorted out for days and I'm getting quite frustrated. I purchased 4 VIP tickets for the upcoming Summer Groove Festival on July 15th for my family, but the payment went through twice (I've attached a screenshot of both charges from my bank statement). While I appreciate the quick confirmation email for the first payment, I need the second charge of $899.50 refunded ASAP."
530,1146,2025-01-12 23:47:28.000,"I'm reaching out about my VIP ticket purchase (MF2023-45721, $189 each) as I'm facing an urgent issue. With the event just three weeks away, I'm getting anxious about resolving this. Due to unforeseen family commitments, specifically a wedding, I'm no longer able to attend and I desperately need assistance with transferring these tickets."
129,989,2025-01-13 11:04:51.000,"Lastly, there seems to be a discrepancy in my account regarding a refund from the canceled Jazz & Soul event last month. The email said it would be processed within 5-7 business days, but it's been two weeks now. Could you please look into this? I've attached a screenshot of my original purchase confirmation for reference."
17,151,2025-01-13 11:36:57.000,"One last thing - the event schedule shows performances starting at 2 PM, but your Instagram post from yesterday mentioned 3 PM. Could you confirm the correct start time?"
46,303,2025-01-13 21:20:15.000,"While I'm here, I'd also like to mention that I love how you've increased the frequency of Latin jazz performances lately - they're always a highlight! That said, the sound quality during last week's performance was a bit off, with too much bass drowning out the horn section. Just thought you should know."
102,1090,2025-01-14 10:05:59.000,"This is particularly frustrating because I spent $289 on this ticket, and now that I can't make it due to a family wedding, I really need to get this sorted. Sarah is a massive techno fan and she's dying to see DJ Starlight's set."
106,208,2025-01-15 01:13:59.000,"I attended last weekend's indie folk festival at Riverbank Arena and wanted to share my experience. While the acoustics were fantastic and I particularly enjoyed the sunset performance on the Garden Stage, I encountered some issues with the mobile ticketing system. During entry, the QR code wouldn't load properly due to poor reception (screenshot attached), causing a 20-minute delay. Several other attendees faced similar problems."
71,35,2025-01-15 02:22:53.000,"The ticket reference number is TIX-2023-89445, purchased on March 15th for $289.50."
137,683,2025-01-15 09:30:23.000,"I attended your indie rock festival last weekend and while the music was incredible (especially that new underground band with the amazing female guitarist!), I'm having issues with getting my VIP ticket refund processed. I was originally supposed to attend with my boyfriend, but we had to leave early on Day 2 due to a family emergency."
666,1177,2025-01-15 17:46:35.000,"I've been enjoying the updates to your mobile app, particularly the dark mode and the more detailed electronic music subgenres. However, I've noticed that the payment processing seems to be taking a bit longer than it used to. Additionally, I've experienced an issue with duplicate charges on two separate occasions last week, although one of the charges was eventually refunded."
150,434,2025-01-15 21:59:07.000,"Firstly, the payment for my VIP upgrade seems to have been charged twice to my credit card. I've attached a screenshot of both transactions from my bank statement. The duplicate charge is for $149.99."
507,1182,2025-01-15 22:42:40.000,"I recently attended the electronic music festival at Starlight Arena and had a mixed experience. The sound system was top-notch for the deep house performances, but I found the bass to be overpowering during the techno sets, particularly near the west stage. I've included a video clip that captures the speaker distortion I encountered."
97,1454,2025-01-16 00:50:16.000,"While I've got your attention, I also  wanted to mention that I love what you're doing with the new underground electronic music series. The monthly frequency is perfect, and as someone who's really into experimental techno and ambient, it's refreshing to see these genres getting proper representation. However, the sound system at The Blue Room venue could use some improvement, especially for the bass-heavy sets."
32,1416,2025-01-16 02:37:16.000,"On a different note, I accidentally purchased two tickets for the upcoming experimental electronic show next month (screenshot of double booking attached). Is it possible to get a refund for one of them? Order #RT789321."
138,610,2025-01-17 06:43:54.000,"I attended the electronic music festival last weekend at Sunset Arena and had mixed feelings about the experience. While the music selection was fantastic (especially loving the deep house and techno sets), I noticed the sound quality at Stage 3 was quite poor - there was constant distortion during peak moments. I've attached a video showing the audio issues."
589,1202,2025-01-17 09:33:25.000,"I had an amazing time at the symphonic metal showcase last week, the production quality was top-notch! The light show during the headliner's performance was truly breathtaking. One minor suggestion for improvement: the card reader at the merchandise stand was a bit temperamental, so it might be worth checking that for future events."
606,1208,2025-01-18 03:07:54.000,"I recently attended the indie folk festival at Riverbank Arena and had a mixed experience. The acoustics were top-notch, and the sunset show on the Garden Stage was a highlight. However, I ran into trouble with the mobile ticketing system when trying to enter the venue. The QR code failed to load due to weak signal strength (see attached screenshot), resulting in a 20-minute wait. Unfortunately, I wasn't the only one - several other festival-goers experienced similar issues."
99,940,2025-01-18 14:18:23.000,"I spent over $450 on these tickets, and I'd really appreciate some clarification on these issues. The duplicate charge needs to be refunded ASAP, and I'd like to know what exactly my VIP benefits include."
52,664,2025-01-18 17:48:24.000,"The mobile app is quite buggy too - it crashes whenever I try to view my ticket barcode. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but no luck. I've attached a screenshot of the error message I'm getting."
517,1228,2025-01-19 12:50:35.000,I'd greatly appreciate it if you could assist me with resolving two issues: the ticket transfer and the duplicate payment. Thank you for your time and for all your efforts in supporting the local music scene.
88,743,2025-01-19 14:59:17.000,"I'm having a really frustrating experience with my recent ticket purchase for the upcoming Summer Jazz Fusion Festival. I bought 4 VIP tickets last Thursday (order #RT789321), but I've been charged twice for the same order! I've attached a screenshot of both transactions from my bank statement."
164,1843,2025-01-19 17:00:48.000,"I purchased two VIP tickets for the upcoming electronic music festival ""Neon Dreams"" on June 15th, but I've encountered several issues I need help with. First, when I try to access my tickets through the mobile app, I keep getting an error message (screenshot attached). I've tried logging out and back in, but no luck."
