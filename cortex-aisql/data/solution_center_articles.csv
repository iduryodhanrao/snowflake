S026,"Fixing Transfer Failures (Codes 2304, 2445, 2468 & ""Try Again Later"")","Fixing Transfer Failures (Codes 2304, 2445, 2468 & ""Try Again Later""):  What the messages mean  
• Code 2304 / 2445 – the ticket is temporarily locked (venue security hold or too many rapid attempts).  
• Code 2468 – payment or fraud‑screen review on the buyer’s order; the ticket can’t move until the review clears.  
• “Transfer failed – try again later” – generic throttle after three consecutive failures.  

Quick fixes  
1. Wait 15 minutes and retry—most locks auto‑release.  
2. Verify both accounts use the same region and that the recipient’s email is spelled exactly as in their profile.  
3. If you’re moving several tickets, transfer one at a time to avoid batch‑size limits.  
4. Make sure your own purchase is fully paid (no pending bank hold) and that the event actually allows transfers (check the banner on the ticket).  

Still stuck?
