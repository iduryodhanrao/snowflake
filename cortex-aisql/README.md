# Getting Started with Cortex AISQL

## Overview

Cortex AISQL reimagines SQL into an AI query language for multimodal data, bringing powerful AI capabilities directly into Snowflake's SQL engine. It enables users to build scalable AI pipelines across text, images, and audio (coming soon) using familiar SQL commands. With native support for multimodal data through a new FILE datatype, Cortex AISQL seamlessly integrates AI operators with traditional SQL primitives like AI_FILTER and AGGREGATE, allowing analysts to process diverse data types more efficiently and cost-effectively while maintaining enterprise-grade security and governance.
