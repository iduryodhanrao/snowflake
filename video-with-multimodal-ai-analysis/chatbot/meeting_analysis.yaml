        sample_values:
          - Going to the last slide? Yeah, before ending the meeting, I'd like to draw some sketch about the future prototype. Go for it. Okay. Well, no, not you. You can finish your slides. Okay, so anyway, users will be... So the findings is users will be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes. So that was very... I thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody. Okay, that's all? Yeah. Okay, so... So, we're done for the presentations. So, we need to take some decisions about what we're going to do. So, I propose that you go to the whiteboard. Yeah. And we're going to report all the ideas we had during these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the final product and our super mango banana and with the basis Extra functionalities such as wheels, the speaker you need in order not to lose the device. I don't remember what you call it. That's right. The basis station. Basis station, yeah. So we're going for a stylish banana shape. Yeah, so I guess you want to hold, like the way, the end of the banana you want to kind of hold, you maybe want to hold like a gun rather than-- because you don't want it to point towards the floor. So if you have like-- What about this shape, more or less? There's less space on this to put the buttons. If it has really the molded shape of a banana-- the starting is good, but it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really. I just think if you don't want to do that movement, which is difficult, if you don't have to do it, in fact, it's better. So time is running. We have to move forward. So let's skip to this ID. Yeah. So we have this. We have a basis. Are you recording it already? The base station? The base station. We'll have a base station extra on the side. OK. So I guess we need something that can fit a banana-shaped object. Yeah. We have a RF for beeping. That's right. OK. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The problem is after all this meeting, there is time. It's a meeting day.
